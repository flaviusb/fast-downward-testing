# So, we need a filename and a name and wallclock time and resources count for the slurm job
# And we also need to either pass through the arguments for gdb.x.sh and/or runner2.sh or we need to get the locations of the generated scripts
# Then we build the things that need building - and get those paths that way
# And generate the slurm script with the paths and fielname and name and wallclock time and etc
# And then we optionally run it if the run option is selected

# # Options:
# ## Mandatory
#    either "--name x" or "--filename x"
#    * name defaults to `basename -s "$filename"`
#    * filename defaults to ./"$name".sl
#    "--wallclock time"
#    "--memory x"
#    either "--path-to-gdbx x" or "--gdbx-... "
#    either "--path-to-runner2sh x" or "--runner2sh-... "
